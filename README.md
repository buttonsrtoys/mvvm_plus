MVVM+ is a lightweight Flutter implementation of MVVM, plus a locator for sharing states via a global registry (like GetIt) or inherited widgets (like Provider).

## Tiny API

MVVM+ extends existing Flutter classes and introduces three methods: `get`, `listenTo`,
and `buildView`:

- **Model** extends ChangeNotifier and adds:
    - get
    - listenTo
- **View** extends StatefulWidget/State and adds:
    - get
    - listenTo
- **ViewModel** extends Model and adds:
    - buildView
- **Property** is a `typedef` of ValueNotifier, so adds nothing.

*But* don't be fooled by MVVM+'s minimal interface. MVVM+ is a full implementation of MVVM.

## Model-View-View Model (MVVM)

As with all MVVM implementations, MVVM+ organizes UI into an object called the View. Business
logic associated with a View is organized into an object called a View Model. Business logic that
spans two or more View Models is organized into one or more Models.

![mvvm flow](https://github.com/buttonsrtoys/mvvm_plus/blob/main/assets/MvvmFlow.png)

States are mutated in the View Model and the Model, but not the View. With MVVM+, the View is a
Flutter widget and the View Model and Model are Dart models that extend ChangeNotifier.

MVVM+ goals:

- *Clearly* separate business logic and state from UI.
- Support access to models in a global registry (like GetIt).
- Support access to models from descendant widgets (like Provider, InheritedWidget).
- Work well alone or with other state management packages (BLoC, RxDart, Provider, GetIt, ...).
- Be scalable and performant, so suitable for both indy and production apps.
- Be simple.
- Be small.

## Views and View Models

To create a View Model, extend ViewModel:

```dart 
class MyWidgetViewModel extends ViewModel {
  String someText;
}
```

To create a View, extend View. You give the super constructor a builder for your ViewModel (via
the "builder" parameter) and you override View's `build` function (just like
StatelessWidget):

```dart
class MyWidget extends View<MyWidgetViewModel> {
  MyWidget({super.key}) : super(builder: () => MyWidgetViewModel());

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(viewModel.someText); // <- your "viewModel" getter
  }
}
```

Views are frequently nested and can be large, like an app page or feature. Or small, like a password
field or a button.

## VSCode mvvm+ extension

The boilerplate for the View and ViewModel classes is very similar to that of StatefulWidget and its State class. So, like the Flutter extension adds a "stful" snippet for writing StatefulWidget boilerplate, the `mvvm plus` extension adds a snippet for writing View and ViewModel classes.

![mvvm plus extension](https://github.com/buttonsrtoys/mvvm_plus_vsce/blob/main/images/Snippet.gif)

Search the VSCode extension marketplace for "mvvm plus". After installing the extension, just start typing "mvvm+" in the edit window and hit `Enter` when the `mvvm+` snippet is highlighted. Then type the name of your widget and the extension will populate the naming for you. Hit tab to edit the build function.

## Rebuilding a View

ViewModel includes a `buildView` method for rebuilding the View. You can call it explicitly:

```dart
class MyWidgetViewModel extends ViewModel {
  int counter;

  void incrementCounter() {
    counter++;
    buildView(); // <- queues View to build
  }
}
```

Or use `buildView` as a listener to bind the ViewModel to the View with a ValueNotifier:

```dart
late final counter = ValueNotifier<int>(0)..addListener(buildView);
```

Because typing `..addListener(buildView)` for every property can get tedious, ViewModel has a convenience method `createProperty` that adds the `buildView` listener for you. So you could refactor the line above as:

```dart
late final counter = createProperty<int>(0);
```

## initState and dispose

Like the Flutter State class associated with StatefulWidget, the ViewModel class has `initState`
and `dispose` member functions which are handy for initialization and teardown.

```dart
class MyWidgetViewModel extends ViewModel {
  late final StreamSubscription<bool> _streamSubscription;

  @override
  initState() {
    super.initState();
    _streamSubscription = Services.someStream.listen(myListener);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _streamSubscription.cancel();
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

## Adding and getting ViewModels from the registry

Occasionally you need to access another widget's ViewModel instance (e.g., if it's an ancestor or on 
another branch of the widget tree). To make a ViewModel globally available, use the View specifier 
`location: Location.registry`:

```dart
class MyOtherWidget extends View<MyOtherWidgetViewModel> {
  MyOtherWidget(super.key) : super(
    location: Location.registry, // <- Adds the ViewModel to the registry
    builder: () => MyOtherWidgetViewModel());
}
```

Views and ViewModels anywhere on the widget tree can access the ViewModel with their `get` or `listenTo` methods.

```dart

final otherViewModel = get<MyOtherWidgetViewModel>();
final otherViewModel = listenTo<MyOtherWidgetViewModel>();
```

Like GetIt, registered ViewModels are not managed by InheritedWidget. So, widgets don't need to be
children of a View widget to get its registered ViewModel. This is a big plus for use cases where
the accessed ViewModel is not an ancestor.

Unlike GetIt the lifecycle of all ViewModel instances (including registered) are bound to the
lifecycle of the View instances that instantiated them. So, when a View instance is removed from the
widget tree, its ViewModel is disposed.

On rare occasions when you need to register multiple ViewModels of the same type, just give each
ViewModel instance a unique name:

```dart
class MyOtherWidget extends View<MyOtherWidgetViewModel> {
  MyOtherWidget(super.key) : super(
    location: Location.registry,
    name: 'Header', // <- unique name
    builder: () => MyOtherWidgetViewModel());
}
```

and then get the ViewModel by type and name:

```dart

final headerText = get<MyOtherWidgetViewModel>(name: 'Header').someText;
final footerText = get<MyOtherWidgetViewModel>(name: 'Footer').someText;
```

## Alternatively, make ViewModels inherited (like Provider, InheritedWidget)

Instead of using the global registry, you have the option of adding ViewModels to the widget tree. Just add the specifier `location: Location.tree`, which makes the ViewModel available to descendants:

```dart
class MyOtherWidget extends View<MyOtherWidgetViewModel> {
  MyOtherWidget(super.key) : super(
    location: Location.tree, // <- Puts ViewModel on the widget tree
    builder: () => MyOtherWidgetViewModel());
}
```

Views and ViewModels that are descendants can use their `context` and `get` or `listenTo` functions to access the ViewModel.

```dart

final otherViewModel = get<MyOtherWidgetViewModel>(context: context);
final otherViewModel = listenTo<MyOtherWidgetViewModel>(context: context);
```

## Models

The Model class is a super class of ViewModel with much of the functionality of ViewModel. MVVM+
uses the [Bilocator](https://pub.dev/packages/bilocator) package under the hood which has a widget
named "Bilocator" that adds Models to the widget tree:

```dart
Bilocator<MyModel>(
  builder: () => MyModel(),
  child: MyWidget(),
);
```

By default, the Bilocator widget adds its model to the global registry when added to the widget tree and unregisters it when
removed. (To register multiple models with a single widget, check out [Bilocators](https://pub.dev/packages/bilocator#registering-models)).

As with the View class, to add a model to the widget tree (instead of the registry), simply specify the `location` to `Location.tree`:

```dart
Bilocator<MyModel>(
  builder: () => MyModel(),
  location: Location.tree, // <- Adds model to widget tree instead of global registry
  child: MyWidget(),
);
```

## Listening to other widget's ViewModels

The `get` method of View and ViewModel retrieves registered ViewModels but does not listen for
future changes. For that, use `listenTo` from within your ViewModel:

```dart
final someText = listenTo<MyOtherWidgetViewModel>().someText;
```

`listenTo` performs a one-time add of the `buildView` method as a listener that is called every time
the `notifyListeners` method of MyOtherWidgetViewModel is called. If you want to do more than just
queue a build, you can give `listenTo` a custom listener function:

```dart
final someText = listenTo<MyWidgetViewModel>(listener: myListener).someText;
```

If you want to rebuild your View after your custom listener finishes, just call `buildView` within
your listener:

```dart
void myListener() {
  // do some stuff
  buildView();
}
```

Either way, listeners added by `listenTo` are automatically removed when your ViewModel instance is
disposed.

## notifyListeners vs buildView

When your View and ViewModel classes are instantiated, `buildView` is added as a listener to your
ViewModel. So, calling `buildView` or `notifyListeners` from within your ViewModel will both rebuild
your View. So, what's the difference between calling `buildView` and `notifyListeners`? Nothing,
unless your ViewModel has other listeners. So, to eliminate unnecessary View builds, it is a best
practice to use `buildView` unless your use case requires listeners to be notified of a change.

## ValueNotifiers are your MVVM Properties!

The MVVM pattern uses the term "Properties" to describe public values of View Models that are bound
to Views and other objects. I.e., when the Property is changed, listeners are notified:

```dart
class MyViewModel {
  final counter = Property<int>(0);
}
```

In Flutter, this is how ValueNotifiers work. So, MVVM+ adds a `typedef` that equates Property with
ValueNotifier. As you use MVVM+, feel free to call your public members of ViewModels "Properties"
or "ValueNotifiers", whichever is more comfortable to you. (In the MVVM+ documentation, I use "
ValueNotifier" to be more transparent with the Flutter underpinnings, but in practice, I prefer to
use "Property" because it clarifies its purpose and because "Property" has fewer characters! :)

So, for more granularity than listening to an entire registered Model, you can `get` a model and `listenTo` one of its
ValueNotifiers/Properties:

```dart
final cloud = get<CloudService>();
final currentUser = listenTo<ValueNotifier<User>>(notifier: cloud.currentUser).value;
```

## FutureProperty and StreamProperty

MVVM+ supports Flutter `Future` and `Stream` with the `FutureProperty` and `StreamProperty`. When 
either of these resolves, its `hasData` field is set to true and its listeners are notified, 
enabling rendering to update and access the values through its `data` field.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return futureName.hasData
    ? Text('${futureName.data}')
    : CircularProgressIndicator();
}
```

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return weatherConditionsStream.hasData
    ? Text('${weatherConditionsStream.data}')
    : CircularProgressIndicator();
}
```

# Mixins

Builds the state than manages this [View]

This functions is already defined for this [View] class so typically doesn't need to be overridden. The exception
is when you need to add a mixin to the state class. To add a mixin, extend ViewState<View<T>> with the mixin:

```dart
class MyWidget extends View<MyWidgetViewModel> {
  MyWidget({super.key}) : super(builder: () => MyWidgetViewModel());

  @override
  // Overriding createState is only required when adding mixins
  MyWidgetState createState() => MyWidgetState();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Use `getState` to retrieve your custom ViewState/mixin object
    return getState<MyWidgetState>().buildGreeting(viewModel.message.value);
  }
}

// Extend `ViewState` and add your mixin
class MyWidgetState extends ViewState<MyWidgetViewModel> with MyMixin {}

mixin MyMixin {
  buildGreeting(String message) => Text(message);
}

class MyWidgetViewModel extends ViewModel {
  late final message = createProperty<String>('Hello');
}
```

# Example

(The source code for the repo example is under the Pub.dev "Example" tab and in the
GitHub `example/lib/main.dart` file.)

This example increments a number (0, 1, 2, ...) and a letter character (a, b, c, ...) using a single
increment floating action button (FAB) that toggles between incrementing the number and the letter.
When the FAB displays "+1" a press increments the number and when it displays "+a" the character
will increment.

Two View widgets are used in this example. One for the increment button/FAB which maintains the
state ("+1"/"+a") and one for the page which maintains current count and other states.

The page listens to two services: one that changes the number color and another that changes the
letter color. The number color service has a stream that emits a new color every N seconds. The
letter color service is a ChangeNotifier with a timer that changes the current letter color and then
calls `notifyListeners`.

## That's it!

The [example app](https://github.com/buttonsrtoys/view/tree/main/example/lib) demos much of the
above functionality and shows how small and organized MVVM+ classes typically are.
